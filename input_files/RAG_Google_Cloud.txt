RAG

What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG)?
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an AI framework that combines the
strengths of traditional information retrieval systems (such as search and
databases) with the capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs).
By combining your data and world knowledge with LLM language skills,
grounded generation is more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant to your
specific needs. Check out this ebook to unlock your “Enterprise Truth.”

How does Retrieval-Augmented Generation work?
RAGs operate with a few main steps to help enhance generative AI outputs:

Retrieval and pre-processing: RAGs leverage powerful search
algorithms to query external data, such as web pages, knowledge bases,
and databases. Once retrieved, the relevant information undergoes preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.
Grounded generation: The pre-processed retrieved information is then
seamlessly incorporated into the pre-trained LLM. This integration
enhances the LLM's context, providing it with a more comprehensive
understanding of the topic. This augmented context enables the LLM to
generate more precise, informative, and engaging responses.

Why use RAG?
RAG offers several advantages augmenting traditional methods of text
generation, especially when dealing with factual information or data-driven
responses. Here are some key reasons why using RAG can be beneficial:

Access to fresh information
LLMs are limited to their pre-trained data. This leads to outdated and
potentially inaccurate responses. RAG overcomes this by providing up-to-date
information to LLMs.

Factual grounding
LLMs are powerful tools for generating creative and engaging text, but they
can sometimes struggle with factual accuracy. This is because LLMs are
trained on massive amounts of text data, which may contain inaccuracies or
biases.
Providing “facts” to the LLM as part of the input prompt can mitigate “gen AI
hallucinations.” The crux of this approach is ensuring that the most relevant
facts are provided to the LLM, and that the LLM output is entirely grounded on
those facts while also answering the user’s question and adhering to system
instructions and safety constraints.

Using Gemini’s long context window (LCW) is a great way to provide source
materials to the LLM. If you need to provide more information than fits into the
LCW, or if you need to scale up performance, you can use a RAG approach
that will reduce the number of tokens, saving you time and cost.

Search with vector databases and relevancy re-rankers
RAGs usually retrieve facts via search, and modern search engines now
leverage vector databases to efficiently retrieve relevant documents. Vector
databases store documents as embeddings in a high-dimensional space,
allowing for fast and accurate retrieval based on semantic similarity. Multimodal embeddings can be used for images, audio and video, and more and
these media embeddings can be retrieved alongside text embeddings or
multi-language embeddings.
Advanced search engines like Vertex AI Search use semantic search and
keyword search together (called hybrid search), and a re-ranker which scores
search results to ensure the top returned results are the most
relevant. Additionally searches perform better with a clear, focused query
without misspellings; so prior to lookup, sophisticated search engines will
transform a query and fix spelling mistakes.

Relevance, accuracy, and quality
The retrieval mechanism in RAG is critically important. You need the best
semantic search on top of a curated knowledge base to ensure that the
retrieved information is relevant to the input query or context. If your retrieved
information is irrelevant, your generation could be grounded but off-topic or
incorrect.
By fine-tuning or prompt-engineering the LLM to generate text entirely based
on the retrieved knowledge, RAG helps to minimize contradictions and
inconsistencies in the generated text. This significantly improves the quality of
the generated text, and improves the user experience.
The Vertex Eval Service now scores LLM generated text and retrieved chunks
on metrics like “coherence,” “fluency,” “groundedness,” "safety,"
“instruction_following,” “question_answering_quality,” and more. These

metrics help you measure the grounded text you get from the LLM (for some
metrics that is a comparison to a ground truth answer you have
provided). Implementing these evaluations gives you a baseline measurement
and you can optimize for RAG quality by configuring your search engine,
curating your source data, improving source layout parsing or chunking
strategies, or refining the user’s question prior to search. A RAG Ops, metrics
driven approach like this will help you hill climb to high quality RAG and
grounded generation.

RAGs, agents, and chatbots
RAG and grounding can be integrated into any LLM application or agent which
needs access to fresh, private, or specialized data. By accessing external
information, RAG-powered chatbots and conversational agents leverage
external knowledge to provide more comprehensive, informative, and contextaware responses, improving the overall user experience.
Your data and your use case are what differentiate what you are building with
gen AI. RAG and grounding bring your data to LLMs efficiently and scalably.
